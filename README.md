# UNIXDB
UNIX based command database with search by description function

Okay so i have commonly found myself doing whatever trying to learn etc, but found that google only helps when you know what your looking for. Enter my database,
you can search by command or description, making it easier to find what you want. I plan on adding more commands as i learn more, including syntax, and expanding to other languages
with the hope of making it easier to find exactly what you need.
